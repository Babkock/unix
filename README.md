This is a variety of GNU coreutils re-implemented in Rust. These examples aim to be efficient, fast, and less complicated.

To compile all of the programs, run the `build.sh` script. You can also compile any of the programs individually with

```
./build.sh programname
```

The compiled and stripped release binaries will be copied to the `build` directory.
